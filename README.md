# js-interview-data-structures

JS Interview Data Structures aims to provide Front End Developers some insight on how one might approach creating traditional OOP data structures in JavaScript. These references are particularly useful for interviews that test front end developers heavily in algorithms and data structures.

Currently this repository features:

1. Binary Search Tree
2. Linked List
3. Queue
4. Set
5. Stack
6. Trie

Best of luck in those interviews!
